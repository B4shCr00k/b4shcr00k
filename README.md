## Hey Everyone

### About me : 
- a computer science student, interested in offensive security, Malware Dev, Os Internals and binary exploitation.

- The goal of sharing these projects is to simply document my work as well as to help anyone that wants to learn ! 

# Currently Working On : 
-- Heaven's Gate (my own hellsgate implementation) 

# To Do Next (in order) : 
- Obfuscation techniques
- Start Writing real malware ( for educational purposes only ofc ;) )

I will finish these projects asap .
### I haven't been active much lately but i tried to learn as much as i can to improve my malware writing techs But i will try to post more.
